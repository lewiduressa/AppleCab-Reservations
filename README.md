This project is a website for a taxi company named AppleCab. It consists of the main page and 
the reservations page, where users can place reservations. 

The main reason why I created this project was to furtuehr advance my experiences
in front-end programming using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end work using Node.js.
More specifically, I wanted to get a hands on experience on connecting my application to an API to successfully exchange data. 
I have accomplished this as the reservations page connects to the MapBox API to fetch data and perform Address auto-filling 
and fetch directions information to show routes on the map.

Note that this website is NOT complete in a lot of ways. It doesn't even perform name, phone number, email validation, 
reason being that that is NOT my goal in this project. The next thing that I can work on is connecting it to credit-card processing APIs (like Stripe) to process payments. 
Moreover, I will need to implement email, address verifications, and additional features to
ensure the site is robust (for instance, ensure the CSS functions properly on smaller devices) if it were to be released. You can
download this project and run it. However, **you will need to get private API-key from MapBox.com for free** to ensure functionality.
