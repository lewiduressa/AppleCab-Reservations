This project is a website for a taxi company named AppleCab. It consists of the main page and 
the reservations page, where users can place reservations. 

The main reason why I created this project was to furtuehr advance my experiences
in front-end programming using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end work using Node.js.
More specifically, I wanted to get a hands on experience on connecting my application to an API to successfully exchange data. 
I have accomplished this as the reservations page connects to the MapBox API to fetch data and perform Address auto-filling 
and fetch directions information to show routes on the map.

Note that this website is NOT complete. The next thing that I can work on is connecting it to credit-card processing APIs
(like Stripe) to process payments. Moreover, I will need to implement email, address verifications, and additional features to
make the site is robust if it were to be used in the real world with different devices.
